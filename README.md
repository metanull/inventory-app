The **Inventory Management API** (inventory-app) is a RESTful API designed to manage the content of the Museum With No Frontiers' inventory database. This application serves as the management layer in a modern N-tier architecture, replacing legacy systems with a scalable, maintainable, and secure solution.

## Project Overview

This API is part of a broader modernization effort for Museum With No Frontiers. The new architecture consists of:

- **Management REST API** (this application): Provides secure endpoints for managing and updating the inventory database.
- **Public Consultation REST API**: Grants controlled, read-only access to inventory data for public-facing applications.
- **Client-side Web Applications**: Deployed separately, these applications interact with the consultation API to present data to end users.

## Why N-Tier Architecture?

Adopting an N-tier architecture brings several advantages:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer (management API, consultation API, frontend clients) has a distinct responsibility, making the system easier to maintain and evolve.
- **Scalability**: Components can be scaled independently based on demand, improving performance and resource utilization.
- **Security**: Sensitive management operations are isolated from public access, reducing the attack surface.
- **Flexibility**: Decoupling backend and frontend allows for independent development, testing, and deployment of each component, enabling faster iteration and easier integration of new technologies.

## Data Model and Features

### Core Data Model

The Inventory Management API is built around a sophisticated data model designed to handle complex museum inventory relationships. The system uses **UUID primary keys** for scalability and distributed system compatibility, with three notable exceptions that use standardized codes:

#### Primary Models

- **Country** üåç - Uses ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes (3-letter country codes)
- **Language** üó£Ô∏è - Uses ISO 639-1 codes (3-letter language codes)
- **User** üë§ - Uses Laravel's default integer primary keys for authentication compatibility

All other models use UUID primary keys for optimal scalability and system integration.

# Image Processing Pipeline

The application features a sophisticated image processing and attachment system:

#### Image Upload and Processing Workflow

1. **Upload**: Images are uploaded via `POST /api/image-upload` and processed asynchronously
2. **Processing**: Background events resize, validate, and optimize images
3. **Available Pool**: Successfully processed images become `AvailableImage` records
4. **Attachment**: Images are attached to models via transactional operations:
    - `POST /api/picture/attach-to-item/{item}` - Attach to Items
    - `POST /api/picture/attach-to-detail/{detail}` - Attach to Details
    - `POST /api/picture/attach-to-partner/{partner}` - Attach to Partners
5. **Management**: Attached images become `Picture` records with full CRUD operations
6. **Detachment**: Pictures can be detached and converted back to AvailableImages:
    - `DELETE /api/picture/{picture}/detach-from-item/{item}` - Detach from Items
    - `DELETE /api/picture/{picture}/detach-from-detail/{detail}` - Detach from Details
    - `DELETE /api/picture/{picture}/detach-from-partner/{partner}` - Detach from Partners

#### Image Storage Configuration

The application uses a flexible storage configuration system with clear separation:

```bash
# Upload temporary storage
UPLOAD_IMAGES_DISK=local_upload_images
UPLOAD_IMAGES_PATH=uploads/images

# Processed images awaiting attachment
AVAILABLE_IMAGES_DISK=local_available_images
AVAILABLE_IMAGES_PATH=available/images

# Permanently attached pictures
PICTURES_DISK=local_pictures
PICTURES_PATH=pictures
```

#### Image Features

- **Automatic Resizing** - Multiple image sizes generated on upload

### Enhanced Composer Commands

The application provides enhanced composer commands that accept additional parameters for flexible development workflows:

#### Testing Commands

```bash
# Standard test execution
composer ci-test

# Pass additional arguments using environment variable
$env:COMPOSER_ARGS="--filter Integration"; composer ci-test

# Common test filtering examples
$env:COMPOSER_ARGS="--filter Picture"; composer ci-test
$env:COMPOSER_ARGS="--filter DetachFromItemTest"; composer ci-test
$env:COMPOSER_ARGS="--group=integration"; composer ci-test
$env:COMPOSER_ARGS="--testsuite=Feature"; composer ci-test

# Helper command for filter-based testing
composer ci-test:filter "YourTestClass"
```

#### Linting Commands

```bash
# Standard linting
composer ci-lint

# Pass additional arguments using environment variable
$env:COMPOSER_ARGS="--test"; composer ci-lint
$env:COMPOSER_ARGS="--config=custom-pint.json"; composer ci-lint
$env:COMPOSER_ARGS="--verbose"; composer ci-lint

composer ci-lint:with-args --test --verbose
```

#### Environment Variable Usage

The enhanced commands support the `COMPOSER_ARGS` environment variable to pass additional parameters:

```powershell
# PowerShell examples
$env:COMPOSER_ARGS="--filter IntegrationTest"
composer ci-test

# Or inline
$env:COMPOSER_ARGS="--coverage"; composer ci-test
