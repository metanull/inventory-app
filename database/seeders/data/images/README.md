# README

## Overview

This folder contains a collection of images sourced from [Picsum](https://picsum.photos/). The images were downloaded using the `download-seed-images.p1` script.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of these images is to enhance automated tests and database seeding processes. By providing a local fallback, these images ensure that tests and seeding operations can proceed even if network connectivity is lost or the Picsum service is unavailable.

## Usage

- Use these images as static assets for testing and seeding.
- If live image generation from Picsum fails due to network or service issues, these images serve as reliable alternatives.
