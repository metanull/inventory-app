# Commit Message Generation

When generating commit messages, follow these guidelines:

- Use unicode characters to decorate the commit message, such as emojis.
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Fix bug" not "Fixes bug")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally
- Include a detailed body if necessary
- Use bullet points for lists in the body
- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
- If the commit relates to an issue, include "Closes #issue_number" in the body to automatically close the issue when the commit is merged
- If the commit relates to a pull request, include "Related to #pr_number" in the body to link the pull request
- For breaking changes, include "BREAKING CHANGE: description of the change" in the body
- Use tags like "feat:", "fix:", "docs:", "style:", "refactor:", "test:", "chore:" at the beginning of the subject line to categorize the commit
- Ensure the commit message is clear and concise, providing enough context for future reference
- Review the commit message for spelling and grammar before finalizing
- Always store the commit message in a temporary markdown file (temp_*.md); and let git use that file as an input to avoid escaping issues.
