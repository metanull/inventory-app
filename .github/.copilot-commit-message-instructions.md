# Commit Message Generation

- Prefer using MCP or VS Code tools to manage PR. If unavailable, use `git` terminal command.
- Use a concise and descriptive title that summarizes the changes made in the pull request.
- Include a detailed description explaining what and why vs. how.
- Use unicode emojis to decorate the title and headlines.
- When PR relates to an issue, include "Closes #issue_number" in the description
- When using the `git commit` terminal  command
  - use a temporary markdown file (temp_*.md) for the message
