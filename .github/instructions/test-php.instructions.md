- Organize tests in a logical and consistent directory structure.
- Keep tests simple and focused on a single behavior.
- Keep tests isolated and independent from each other.
- Use meaningful test names that describe the behavior being tested.
- In test, never assume existence of a record, create records using factories and use the `refreshDatabase` trait.
- Use existing tests as a reference for creating new tests maintaining consistency:
