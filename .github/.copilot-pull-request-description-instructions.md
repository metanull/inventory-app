# Pull request Title and Description Generation

When generating pull request follow these guidelines:

- Prefer using MCP or VS Code tools to manage PR. If unavailable, use `gh pr` terminal command.
- Use a concise and descriptive title that summarizes the changes made in the pull request.
- Include a detailed description explaining what and why vs. how.
- Use unicode emojis to decorate the title and headlines.
- When PR relates to an issue, include "Closes #issue_number" in the description
- Before creating the PR (but after the push), run semantic versioning (npm version patch|minor|major)
- When using the `gh pr create` terminal command
  - do not append `--label`, `--merge`, or `--auto` options.
  - append the `--assignee "@me"` option.
  - use a temporary markdown file (temp_*.md) for the description
- If user wants auto-merge, use squash mode.
