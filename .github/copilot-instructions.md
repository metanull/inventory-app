## Standards
- This repository is a Laravel application.
- This repository uses PHP 8.2 or higher.
- This repository follows the Laravel standard.
- This repository adheres to the PSR-12 coding standard.
- This repository uses the PSR-4 autoloading standard.
- This repository uses Pint for code formatting and style checking.

## Naming Conventions
- Always comply with Laravel's naming conventions.
- Use `snake_case` for database columns and table names.
- Use `kebab-case` for URLs and routes.
- Use `snake_case` for configuration files.
- Use `camelCase` for variable and function names.
- Use `PascalCase` for class names and methods.
- Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants.

## Testing the API
- Use PHPUnit for testing.
- Use the `tests/Feature` directory for API tests.
- Use `php artisan make:test` to create new test classes.
- All tests classes shall contain `use RefreshDatabase, WithFaker;` to insure proper isolation and data generation.
  - This line is to be placed first inside the class declaration.
  - For example:
    ```php
    use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;
    use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\WithFaker;
    use Tests\TestCase;

    class MyModelTest extends TestCase
    {
        use RefreshDatabase, WithFaker;
    }
    ```
- Use `php artisan test` to run tests.
- Use `php artisan test --coverage` to generate a code coverage report.
- Test every route in the `routes/api.php` file.
- Test names should be descriptive and follow the format:
  `test_[ControllerMethod]_[Scenario]`.
- Organize tests into focused test classes by functionality within entity-specific directories.
  - For each entity (e.g., `User`), create a directory under `tests/Feature/Api/` (e.g., `tests/Feature/Api/User/`).
  - Within each entity directory, create separate test files for different aspects:
    - `AnonymousTest.php` - Tests for unauthorized access scenarios
    - `IndexTest.php` - Tests for listing/index operations
    - `ShowTest.php` - Tests for showing single records
    - `StoreTest.php` - Tests for creating new records
    - `UpdateTest.php` - Tests for updating existing records
    - `DestroyTest.php` - Tests for deleting records
  - Each test file should focus only on tests relevant to its specific functionality.
  - Each test file should include a `protected ?User $user = null;` property and a `setUp()` method that creates and authenticates a user.
  - For example, for a `User` model, create:
    - `tests/Feature/Api/User/AnonymousTest.php`
    - `tests/Feature/Api/User/IndexTest.php`
    - `tests/Feature/Api/User/ShowTest.php`
    - `tests/Feature/Api/User/StoreTest.php`
    - `tests/Feature/Api/User/UpdateTest.php`
    - `tests/Feature/Api/User/DestroyTest.php`
- Ensure that tests are concise and focused on a single aspect of the functionality.
- Use the `assert` methods provided by PHPUnit to validate the expected outcomes.
- Always use the `route()` helper to generate URLs for testing.
- When using the `route()` helper, ensure that the route name is used correctly. 
  - Route names are defined in the `routes/api.php` file.
  - Route names autogenerated by the Resource controllers comply with Laravel's naming conventions:
    - the name of the route is the singular form of the model's database table, followed by the action.
    - For example, for the `UserResource` (based on the `User` model), the name of the database table is `users` and the name of the route is `user`:
      - `user.index` for the index method
      - `user.show` for the show method
      - `user.store` for the store method
      - `user.update` for the update method
      - `user.destroy` for the destroy method
- Categorize tests according to the process they are testing.
  - Tests related to the Factory are in the category 'Factory'.
    - For every factory, make a distinct test to assert that the factory creates the expected data
      - The name of this test should follow the format `test_factory`.
    - For every factory method, make a distinct test to assert that the factory creates the expected data.
      - The name of this test should follow the format `test_factory_[FactoryMethod]`.
      - For example, if the `UserFactory` has a method `withEmail`, then all tests related to the factory must be repeated with the `withEmail` method.
        - The name of these tests should follow the format `test_factory_withEmail`.
  - Tests related to the HTTP responses are in the category 'Response'.
    - For every response make a distinct test to assert the status code of the response.
      - The name of this test should follow the format `test_[ControllerMethod]_returns_[StatusCode]_on_[Scenario]`.
    - For every response make a distinct test to assert the structure of the response.
      - The name of this test should follow the format `test_[ControllerMethod]_returns_the_expected_structure`.
    - For every response make a distinct test to assert the content of the response.
      - The name of this test should follow the format `test_[ControllerMethod]_returns_the_expected_data`.
    - Prefer the Response tests to use the `assertJsonStructure` to validate the response structure.
    # - Prefer the Response tests to use the `assertJsonPath` methods to validate the response content, when the response has a single item.
    # - Prefer the Response tests to use the `assertJson` methods to validate the response content, when the response has multiple items.
    - Prefer the Response tests to use the `assertJsonPath` methods to validate the response content
    - Prefer the methods `assertOk`, `assertCreated`, `assertNoContent`, `assertNotFound`, and `assertUnprocessable` to validate the status code of the response.
  - Tests related to the validation of the request data are in the category 'Validation'.
    - For every `store` and `update` method, make a distinct test to assert that input validation is performed.
      - The name of this test should follow the format `test_[ControllerMethod]_validates_its_input`.
  - Tests related to the authentication and authorization are in the category 'Authentication'.
    - For every route make a distinct test to assert that authenticated access is allowed.
      - The name of this test should follow the format `test_[ControllerMethod]_allows_authenticated_users`.
    - For every route make a distinct test to assert that anonymous access is forbidden.
      - The name of this test should follow the format `test_[ControllerMethod]_forbids_anonymous_access`.
  - Tests related to the process performed by the controller are in the category 'Process'.
    - For every `store`, `update` and `destroy` method, make a distinct test to assert that the underlying database record is impacted.
      - The name of this test should follow the format `test_[ControllerMethod]_[creates|updates|deletes]_a_row`.
  - When the factory has extra methods, all HTTP Response tests may be repeated with the extra methods.
    - For example:
        - `test_[ControllerMethod]_[extra_method]_returns_[StatusCode]_on_[Scenario]` 
        - `test_[ControllerMethod]_[extra_method]_returns_the_expected_structure`
        - `test_[ControllerMethod]_[extra_method]_returns_the_expected_data`
  - For example, the `User` model has a `UserResource`, `UserFactory` and `UserController`.
    The `UserFactory` has one method: `withEmail`.
    The `UserController` has five methods: `index`, `show`, `store`, `update`, `destroy`.
    The test case shall include all of the following tests:
    - `test_factory`.
    - `test_factory_withEmail`.
    - `test_index_allows_authenticated_users`.
    - `test_index_forbids_anonymous_access`.
    - `test_show_allows_authenticated_users`.
    - `test_show_forbids_anonymous_access`.
    - `test_store_allows_authenticated_users`.
    - `test_store_forbids_anonymous_access`.
    - `test_update_allows_authenticated_users`.
    - `test_update_forbids_anonymous_access`.
    - `test_destroy_allows_authenticated_users`.
    - `test_destroy_forbids_anonymous_access`.
    - `test_index_returns_all_rows`.
    - `test_show_returns_one_row`.
    - `test_store_creates_a_row`.
    - `test_update_updates_a_row`.
    - `test_destroy_deletes_a_row`.
    - `test_index_returns_ok_on_success`.
    - `test_show_returns_ok_on_success`.
    - `test_show_returns_not_found_when_record_does_not_exist`.
    - `test_store_returns_created_on_success`.
    - `test_store_returns_unprocessable_entity_when_input_is_invalid`.
    - `test_update_returns_ok_on_success`.
    - `test_update_returns_not_found_when_record_does_not_exist`.
    - `test_update_returns_unprocessable_entity_when_input_is_invalid`.
    - `test_destroy_returns_no_content_on_success`.
    - `test_destroy_returns_not_found_when_record_does_not_exist`.
    - `test_index_returns_the_expected_structure`.
    - `test_show_returns_the_expected_structure`.
    - `test_store_returns_the_expected_structure`.
    - `test_update_returns_the_expected_structure`.
    - `test_destroy_returns_the_expected_structure`.
    - `test_index_returns_the_expected_data`.
    - `test_show_returns_the_expected_data`.
    - `test_store_returns_the_expected_data`.
    - `test_update_returns_the_expected_data`.
    - `test_destroy_returns_the_expected_data`.
    - `test_store_validates_its_input`.
    - `test_update_validates_its_input`.
- When testing a route that requires authentication, use the `actingAs` method to simulate an authenticated user.
  - Each test file should include a `protected ?User $user = null;` property and a `setUp()` method that handles user creation and authentication.
  - For example:
    ```php
    protected ?User $user = null;

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        parent::setUp();
        $this->user = User::factory()->create();
        $this->actingAs($this->user);
    }
    ```
  - For testing anonymous access, use `withHeaders(['Authorization' => ''])` to simulate unauthenticated requests.
  - For example:
    ```php
    $response = $this->withHeaders(['Authorization' => ''])
        ->getJson(route('user.index'));
    ```

## Error Handling
- Use try-catch blocks for asynchronous operations.
- Always log errors with meaningful messages.
- Always handle exceptions gracefully.

## Annotation
- Use PHPDoc for class and method annotations.
- Use Laravel's built-in validation annotations for request validation.
- Use dedoc/Scramble annotations for Controller methods.
- When adding annotations, ensure they are clear and concise.
- When adding annotations, explain the purpose of that annotation.

## Code Comments
- Use comments to explain complex logic.
- Use comments to clarify the purpose of a function or method.
