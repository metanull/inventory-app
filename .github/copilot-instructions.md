# Copilot Coding Agent Instructions (concise)

## General Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Never modify files through scripting. All changes must be made through explicit code edits.
**CRITICAL**: Always maintain consistency with existing code patterns and conventions.
  - **CRITICAL**: Verify existing implementation before code changes to ensure alignment with project's patterns and standards. If new issues are found, even if not directly related to the user request, fix them as part of the task.
**CRITICAL**: The project is in active development; breaking changes are accepted, there is no need to preserve backward compatibility.
**CRITICAL**: Use VS Code tools instead of terminal when possible.
  - **CRITICAL**: Use `git rm` to remove files if no VS Code tools exists for that.
**CRITICAL**: Use VS Code testing to run tests.
**CRITICAL**: Always implement the entire user request (do not prioritize, take shortcuts, or leave tasks for later)
**CRITICAL**: All warnings and all errors must be addressed, none are acceptable.
**CRITICAL**: The terminal tool uses Windows PowerShell; never use *nix commands; use windows powershell compatbile escaping.

## Project Overview

This is a Laravel 12 project powered by PHP 8.2. **CRITICAL**: Always use the right version of their documentation.
**CRITICAL**: Always follow Laravel conventions and best practices.
**CRITICAL**: Avoid adding new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.

### Project Structure & Key Components

This project contains several distinct elements:
- "/" directory: A standard Laravel application using Sanctum, Fortify and Jetstream
- "/api-client" directory - An automatically generated TypeScript API client for the Laravel backend API.
  - Never directly modify files in this directory; they are auto-generated.
  - Use `composer ci-openapi-doc` to generate the OpenAPI specification (docs/_openapi/api.json) and the TypeScript client in `/api-client/`
  - Use `.\scripts\publish-api-client.ps1 -Credential (Get-Secret github-package)` to publish the TypeScript client to our private github package registry.
- "/docs" directory - A distinct documentation website powered by Jekyll (Ruby)
  - It is deployed separately on GitHub Pages by CI/CD workflows
  - It contains auto generated elements maintained by CI/CD workflows (e.g. git commit history)
  - It contains manually maintained documentation pages (e.g. /docs/index.md, /docs/guidelines/*.md, etc.) that are transformed by Jekyll into static HTML pages by CI/CD workflows.
  - To test the documentation locally, use WSL to run Ruby/Jekyll commands.
- "/resources/js" directory - A sample SPA frontend application demonstrating usage of the API backend via the generated TypeScript API client.
  - It is totally independent from the main Laravel application.

### Key web routes and components

The laravel application exposes several components via distinct classes of routes:
  - "/api" route - The REST API backend
    - It aims to be a pure API backend, with no frontend code.
  - "/web" route - A server-rendered Blade frontend using Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS
    - **CRITICAL**: It NEVER uses the API backend for data interactions; all data interactions are done via Laravel models and controllers directly.
    - It is the main frontend for end users.
  - "/cli" route - A sample "api client" SPA frontend implementation. It aims at demonstrating usage of the API backend from a SPA application.
    - It is totally independent from the main frontend.
    - Its source code is in /resources/js
    - It uses Vue 3 + TypeScript, with Pinia.
    - **CRITICAL**: It NEVER uses direct HTTP calls (fetch, axios, etc.) to interact with the API backend.
    - **CRITICAL**: It uses exclusively the api-client from our github package repository to interact with the API.
     generated API client in /api-client for all API interactions.
  - "/api/docs" route - An auto-generated OpenAPI documentation page powered by swagger-ui.
    - It is generated by Laravel automatically, no manual maintenance is needed.

### Quality Standards

- Code must be linted and formatted according to project standards before push/PR.
  - Use Laravel Pint for PHP code and ESLint for other code (npm run lint is configured to handle js, ts, md, etc.).
- Code must be covered by tests before push/PR.
  - Use PHPUnit for backend code and Vitest for frontend code.
  - Tests must be run via VS Code testing features.
  - All tests must pass locally and without warnings before push/PR.
  - Tests must be simple, single-purpose, deterministic, independent, and explicit about their dependencies.
  - Tests must consistently use mocking/faking for all external dependencies.
  - Tests must consistently follow existing project patterns and directory structures; use existing tests as examples.
  - Tests must be exempt from assumptions and flaky behavior; they must test the actual implementation and the intended behavior reliably.
- All TypeScript code must be free of warnings and errors before push/PR.
- Source control rules:
  - Never push/commit directly to `main`. Changes must be transmitted via Pull Requests.
  - Create a dedicated branch when starting to work on a new request. Always ensure that you're working on the latest code before handling a new request.

### Coding Conventions & Patterns

- Conventions for the main Laravel application:
  - Every new model must include Migration, Resource, Controller, Factory, Seeder and Tests.
  - Controllers must use dedicated Request and Resource classes for input validation and output formatting.
  - Never alter existing migrations; create new migrations for schema changes.
  - UUID primary keys are used for all models (with the only exception of Language and Country that are using 3 character long iso codes).
- Conventions for the Sample SPA application:
  - Use Pinia for state management
  - Use Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript for all components.
  - Use Tailwind CSS for styling; do not use custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.
  - Use components to avoid code duplication; do not repeat code across multiple components.
  - Use the generated API client in `api-client/` for all API interactions; do not use `fetch` or `axios` directly.
  - Follow existing store patterns for actions, getters, and state organization.
- Conventions for the documentation site (Jekyll):
  - The main configuration for Jekyll is in `_config.yml`.
  - The site uses simpledocs theme as base.
  - All md files must include proper front matter with layout, title, nav_order, and other relevant fields (e.g. parent, permalink and has_children must be added when applicable).
  - Any directory that is part of the documentation must contain an `index.md`.
  - Keep the navigation structure in sync with the actual files and their front matter.
  - Hyperlinks are transformed by Jekyll during site generation; follow these rules when creating links in markdown files:
      - Links to a directory must include the trailing slash. e.g. `[API Models](api-models/)` is a valid link to the directory `/docs/api-models/` and will point to `/docs/api-models/index.md`
      - Links to a file must omit the trailing extension. e.g. `[guidelines](guidelines)` is a valid link to the file `/docs/guidelines.md`
      - For cross-references between sections, use front matter permalinks.
      - Links must always omit the `/docs/` prefix.
      - Never extrapolate how the link target will be transformed; always use the exact path as per the rules above.
      - Always use "absolute links", starting with `/` (where / is the root of the documentation and maps to our /docs/ directory). E.g. `[Guidelines](/guidelines)` is an absolute link mapping to our `/docs/guidelines` directory (and more precisely to its index.md file).
      - Create links to non-markdown files (e.g. json, images, etc.) by creating a markdown placeholder file, with `permalink` and `layout: null` frontmatter fields. 
        - To create publish our /docs/_openapi/api.json file as '/api.json' on the generated website: create a file `docs/api.json.md` with the following content:
            ```
            ---
            layout: null
            permalink: /api.json
            ---
            {% include_relative _openapi/api.json %}
            ```
        - To create an hyperlink to that file, use its front matter permalink's value. e.g. `[OpenAPI Spec](/api.json)`.
