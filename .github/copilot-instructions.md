This is a Laravel 12+ project, so when providing code samples or instructions, please ensure they are compatible with Laravel 12 or later.

The project primarily defines a REST API allowing the management of a database; the API documentation is generated by the dedoc/Scramble package. The application also exposes a few out-of-the-box (not customized) web routes to permit managing the users and their JWT tokens. When providing code samples or instructions, please ensure they are compatible with the dedoc/Scramble package for API documentation.

We use Laravel tools to validate the code. It is expected that all pushed commits have been properly linted, and that all tests are passing. When providing code samples, please ensure they are formatted correctly for Laravel and follow the best practices for the framework. This includes using Eloquent models, controllers, and routes as per Laravel conventions. When reviewing pull requests, please ensure that the code adheres to the project's coding standards and best practices, and that it includes appropriate tests for any new functionality or changes made.

We use eloquent Models that are database agnostic, meaning they can be used with any database supported by Laravel. When providing code samples, please ensure that they do not rely on specific database features or syntax that would limit their portability across different database systems.

Our goal is to provide a stable and maintainable codebase for our Rest API, so please ensure that any code samples or instructions adhere to the principles of clean code, including proper naming conventions, modularity, and readability.

Another goal is to limit the use of third-party packages to those that are essential for the functionality of the application. When providing code samples, please ensure that they do not introduce unnecessary dependencies or complexity.

Finally, we aim to provide a secure and robust API, so please ensure that any code samples or instructions adhere to best practices for security in Laravel applications, including proper validation, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.

Our team uses github issues to track bugs and feature requests. When providing code samples or instructions, please ensure that they are clear and concise, and that they address the specific issue or feature request being discussed. When reviewing pull requests, please ensure that the git commits and pr include a clear description of the changes made, the reasoning behind them, and any relevant context or references to issues or discussions.
