# Auto-Generated Model Documentation

⚠️ **DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY MANUALLY** ⚠️

This directory contains **automatically generated** documentation of Laravel Eloquent models.

## What is this?

Each markdown file in this directory represents one Laravel model:
- Model properties and attributes
- Database table structure
- Relationships (belongsTo, hasMany, etc.)
- Scopes and accessors/mutators
- Model-specific methods

## How is it generated?

Generated by: `php artisan docs:models --force`

Triggered by:
- **Manually:** Run the artisan command when models change
- **Recommended:** Run after adding/modifying models

## How to update?

```bash
# From project root
php artisan docs:models --force
```

The `--force` flag ensures existing files are overwritten with current model definitions.

## File Structure

```
_model/
├── index.md                    # Auto-generated index with all models
├── Address.md                  # Individual model documentation
├── Artist.md
├── AvailableImage.md
└── ... (one file per model)
```

## Integration with Jekyll

These files are:
- ✅ Served as static content by Jekyll
- ✅ Accessible via `/models/` URL (redirected from `docs/models/index.md`)
- ✅ Searchable through site search
- ⚠️ Not part of a Jekyll collection (just regular markdown files)

## Important Notes

- ✅ **Committed to Git:** Yes, for documentation availability
- ⚠️ **Edit manually:** No, changes will be overwritten
- 🔄 **Regenerate frequency:** Run artisan command when models change
- 📝 **Source of truth:** Laravel model class files in `app/Models/`

## Known Issues

The generation script (`php artisan docs:models`) has some issues:
- Sometimes fails intermittently
- Generated index.md may contain excessive text/emoticons
- May need manual cleanup after generation

## Related Files

- Artisan command: Defined in Laravel application
- Models source: `app/Models/*.php`
- Jekyll redirect: `docs/models/index.md` (redirects here)
- Configuration: Check Laravel service providers for command registration

## Alternative: Manual Documentation

If the auto-generation is problematic, consider:
1. Document models manually in `docs/models/`
2. Update docs when models change
3. Remove auto-generation and this directory
