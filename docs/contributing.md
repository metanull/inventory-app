# Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions to the Inventory Management API! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this RESTful API project built with PHP 8.2+ and Laravel 12.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/inventory-app.git
cd inventory-app

# Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/metanull/inventory-app.git
```

### 2. Retrieve Dependencies

```bash
# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Install Node.js dependencies (for frontend assets and code quality tools)
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Development Environment

#### Using our composer scripts

_See `composer.json` for a list of ci/cd scripts_

```bash
composer ci-reset
```

#### Or using artisan

```bash
# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Generate application key
php artisan key:generate

# Set up database and run migrations
php artisan migrate --seed

# Build frontend assets
npm run build
```

[#### Using Composer Scripts (Recommended)]

To quickly set up your environment, use our custom composer scripts. These automate database setup, migrations, and seeding for both development and testing:

```powershell
composer ci-reset
```

- This command will:
  - Drop and recreate the database (using SQLite in-memory for development/testing)
  - Run all migrations
  - Seed the database with the default seeders

#### Manual Setup with Artisan

If you need more control or want to customize the seeding process, use Laravel Artisan commands:

```powershell
# Copy environment file and configure your settings
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database and app configuration

# Generate application key
php artisan key:generate

# Run migrations and seed the database
php artisan migrate --seed
```

#### Seeding Optimization

The application supports multiple seeding strategies to optimize development and testing:

- **Default Seeding** (`php artisan db:seed` or `composer ci-seed`):  
  Seeds the database with essential data for development and basic testing. Uses local images by default for reliability and performance.

- **Optimized Seeding** (`$env:FAKER_USE_LOCAL_IMAGES='true'; php artisan db:seed --class=FastDatabaseSeeder`):  
  Seeds the database with a larger, more complex dataset for performance, integration, or edge-case testing.  
  Use this when you need to simulate production-like data volumes or test specific scenarios.

- **Remote Images** (`$env:FAKER_USE_LOCAL_IMAGES='false'; php artisan db:seed`):  
  Forces the use of remote image downloads (with automatic fallback to local images on network failure).  
  Useful for testing network dependency scenarios.

- **Custom Seeder**:  
  You can run any specific seeder by specifying its class:
  ```powershell
  php artisan db:seed --class=YourCustomSeeder
  ```

**When to use which seeding version:**

- Use **default seeding** for everyday development and feature work.
- Use **optimized seeding** when working on performance, scalability, or integration tests.
- Use **remote images** for testing network scenarios or when you need fresh remote content.
- Use **custom seeders** for targeted testing or when developing new features that require specific data.

#### Build Frontend Assets

```powershell
npm run build
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
php artisan serve
```

## üìã Essential Guidelines

Before contributing, please review our development guidelines:

### [üìñ Coding Guidelines](guidelines/coding-guidelines/)

- PHP 8.2+ and Laravel 12 standards
- Model, Controller, and Resource structure
- Database design with Eloquent ORM
- Quality controls and best practices
- API architecture patterns
- RESTful API design principles

### [üß™ Testing Guidelines](guidelines/testing/)

- Testing requirements and coverage (924+ tests)
- Unit, Feature, and Integration testing standards
- PHPUnit and Laravel testing best practices
- Code review criteria and validation

## üè∑Ô∏è Automated Versioning

This project uses **automated semantic versioning** based on GitHub pull request labels. Understanding this system is crucial for contributors.

### Version Bump Labels

**Every pull request MUST include one of these labels:**

| Label | Version Bump | Example | When to Use |
|-------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| `bugfix` | **Patch** | 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1 | Bug fixes, documentation updates, code cleanup |
| `feature` | **Minor** | 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0 | New features, enhancements, non-breaking additions |
| `breaking-change` | **Major** | 1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0 | Breaking API changes, removed functionality |

### How the Automation Works

1. **Create PR** ‚Üí CI runs all tests and validations
2. **Tests pass** ‚Üí Version bump job analyzes PR labels
3. **Version updated** ‚Üí New version automatically committed to your PR branch
4. **PR reviewed & merged** ‚Üí Deployment uses the correct version
5. **App updated** ‚Üí New version visible in application footer

### Label Guidelines

**üü¢ Use `bugfix` for:**
- Bug fixes and error corrections
- Documentation improvements
- Code refactoring without functional changes
- Performance optimizations (without API changes)
- Test improvements

**üü° Use `feature` for:**
- New API endpoints or features
- Enhancements to existing functionality  
- New database models or migrations
- Non-breaking configuration changes
- New frontend components or pages

**üî¥ Use `breaking-change` for:**
- Removing or modifying existing API endpoints
- Changing request/response formats
- Database schema changes that require migration
- Configuration changes that break existing setups
- Removing deprecated functionality

### Example Workflows

```bash
# Bug fix workflow
git checkout -b fix/login-validation-error
# Make your changes
# Create PR with 'bugfix' label ‚Üí Results in patch bump

# New feature workflow  
git checkout -b feature/user-dashboard
# Make your changes
# Create PR with 'feature' label ‚Üí Results in minor bump

# Breaking change workflow
git checkout -b breaking/redesign-api-endpoints
# Make your changes  
# Create PR with 'breaking-change' label ‚Üí Results in major bump
```

### Important Notes

- **Default behavior**: If no label is applied, defaults to `patch` bump
- **Label priority**: `breaking-change` > `feature` > `bugfix`
- **Automatic commit**: The version bump commit appears in your PR automatically
- **No manual versioning**: Never manually edit `package.json` version number

> **üí° Pro Tip**: Add labels when creating the PR or immediately after. The version bump happens after CI passes, so you'll see the version commit appear in your PR before it's merged!

## üìù Contribution Process

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
